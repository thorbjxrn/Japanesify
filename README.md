# Japanesify
A WebExtension that will replace latin letters with selected Japanese characters. The idea is to gradually expand and practice the Japanese alphabets without intense study sessions.
This WebExtension uses local storage to save preferences.

## What it does
* Replaces latin letters with groups of Hiragana.
* Can quickly be enabled and disabled

## Intended future features
* Option for Katakana
* Enable/Disable for specific pages
* Lookup conversion chart

## Acknowledgements

* This WebExtension is built upon Mozilla's "emoji-substitute" WebExtension example.
